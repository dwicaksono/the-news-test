## Repository Description

This web application utilizes data fetched from the free API provided by [developer.nytimes.com](https://developer.nytimes.com). It's built with cutting-edge technologies including:

- **Next.js 14:** Leveraging the latest capabilities of server components for enhanced performance and dynamic content rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilizing a utility-first CSS framework for rapid and efficient styling.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Implemented to facilitate seamless and continuous content loading for a better user experience.
- **Pagination:** Incorporated to organize and display extensive data across multiple pages efficiently.
- **Search Filter:** Integrated to empower users to easily search and filter through the available content, enhancing accessibility and usability.

This project demonstrates the power of Next.js server components, the flexibility of Tailwind CSS for styling, and features like infinite scrolling, pagination, and search functionality to create a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
rename file from .env.example to .env

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
